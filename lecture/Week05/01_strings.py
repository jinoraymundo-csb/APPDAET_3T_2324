# Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed in single (') or 
# double (") quotes.

# You can also build a multiline string by enclosing the
# characters in triple quotes (""") or (''')

# You can use the * operator to repeat strings

# You can use the + operator to concatenate strings

# in the print() function, you can use comma (,) to
# concatenate strings, but it adds a space between them.


print(" APPDAET " * 10)
print("The quick " + "brown fox")

# print("APPDAET" / 2)
# print("APPDAET" - 2)
